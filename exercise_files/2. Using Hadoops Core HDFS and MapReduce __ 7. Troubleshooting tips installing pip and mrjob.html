<h4><strong>Installing mrjob on HDP&nbsp;2.5</strong></h4><p>While going through the next activity, many students are running into an error when entering the command:</p><p><code>pip install google-api-python-client==1.6.4</code></p><p>This seems to arise from a mismatch between python-pip and Python 2.6, but I'm not sure why it only happens for some students and not others. If you do run into this, just update your sandbox to Python 2.7 by entering the following commands:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">yum install scl-utils
yum install centos-release-scl
yum install python27
scl enable python27 bash</pre><p>Now, you should be able to </p><p><code>pip install google-api-python-client==1.6.4</code></p><p>successfully.</p><p> </p><p>If you're still having trouble, please use the Q&amp;A&nbsp;feature for this lecture and we'll help you out.<br></p>
